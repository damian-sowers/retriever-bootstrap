Retriever: A Bootstrap Theme with a Very Small Footprint
=========

See the demo: [http://www.3solarmasses.com/retriever-bootstrap/](http://www.3solarmasses.com/retriever-bootstrap/)

This theme gives bootstrap a new menu with a stich background, a new well design and new fonts. The theme is only 60 lines of CSS so it doesn't get in your way. 

### Installation: 

Just download the [zip](https://github.com/damian-sowers/retriever-bootstrap/zipball/master) and include retriever.css after bootstrap.css (and after bootstrap-responsive if you want it to be responsive). You will also need the stich.png image for the header. 

For a fixed header navbar, be sure to include an 80px padding at the top of your document. To change to a static navbar, just change "navbar-fixed-top" to "navbar-static-top" and alter the top padding to around 20px.
